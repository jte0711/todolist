This is a to-do list that I made using ReactJs. You can input new to-do by writing on the given box, tick-off the items when you're done, and delete it when you no longer need it. All of the data stored in the cache.

**Please feel free to comment about the code or anything, I'm new to ReactJs and web programming and looking to improve myself. **
